The quantis library in version 2.9 or earlier is not compatible with the
recent version of the libusb library (version 1.0.9 or higher). To be more
specific, libQuantis 2.9 (package quantis-v11.12.13.zip) does not work with
libusb-1.0.9 installed on Ubuntu 12.04. However, the quantis library works with
libusb-1.0.8 installed on Ubuntu 11.10. 

According to Quantis developers, the new version of the quantis library, fixing
this problem, will be released in September 2012. Meanwhile, one can use a
simple solution which allows running the package or any application using
libQuantis. In order to do this one needs to execute the following 

1) Download libusb in version 1.0.8 from

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/libusb-1.0.8/libusb-1.0.8.tar.bz2

2) Open the terminal emulator window and unpack the archive

  tar xjf libusb-1.0.8.tar.bz2

3) Go to the source directory

  cd libusb-1.0.8/

3) Configure the library with some custom installation prefix

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/LibUSB
  
Note that it is also possible to use custom prefix in $HOME directory like

  ./configure --prefix=~/Apps/LibUSB

4) Build and install (as root) the library

  sudo make install

This will create lib and include sub-directories in /usr/local/LibUSB

5) Instruct the loader to use the custom version of libusb by 
modifying LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/LibUSB/lib

6) Run Mathematica from the shell with the modified environment

  mathematica

7) The TRQS package should now use libusb located in /usr/local/LibUSB/lib
