\section{Establising connection with the QRGN server}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to retrive data from the QRNG service provided by the PicoQuant and the
Department of Physics of Humboldt University, it is necessary to register on the
service web page~\cite{qrng-www}. In order to establish a connection with the server one can use
one of the function
\begin{itemize}
    \item \lstinline{qrng_connect(qrng_username, qrng_password)} -- establish a
      connection with the QRNG service (qrng.physik.hu-berlin.de:4499),

    \item \lstinline{qrng_connect_SSL(qrng_username, qrng_password)} --
      establish a secure connection with the QRNG service using SSL.
\end{itemize}
Both functions require username and password provided during the registration.
The connection is closed using \lstinline{qrng_disconnect()} function.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \lstinline{qrng_disconnect()} -- close the connection with the QRNG
	server.
\end{itemize}

\section{Retriving random data}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
QRNG service allows to retrive random data in the form of integer number, double precision numbers or byte
