TRQS is a package for Mathematica computing system. This is a preliminary README
file and contains only a minimal compilation and installation instructions.

* Configuration
The MathLink source files must be configure prior to the compilation. Edit
TRQS.h file to define QUANTIS_DEVICE_TYPE (QUANTIS_DEVICE_USB or
QUANTIS_DEVICE_PCI) and QUANTIS_DEVICE_ID (eg. 0) according to your hardware
configuration.

* Compilation
- In order to compile *.tm source files one should note that
  - A working Mathematica installation is required.
  - We assume that header files are installed in /usr/local/IDQ/Quantis/include
    and libraries in /usr/local/IDQ/Quantis/lib. Modify QUANTIS_HOME in the
    Makefile if this is not the case.

- Consult quantis_installation.pdf document in the case of problems with 
  Quantis installation.
- It is also possible to run the package without a Quantis device. In order 
  to do this use Makefile.NoHw makefile to compile MathLink executables.

* Installation
- Make sure that the dynamic loader know where to search for libQuantis (e.g. 
  add /usr/local/IDQ/Quantis/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf).
- Copy TRQS.m to $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications director
- Copy compiled files to $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications/TRQS_Quantis directory.

* Examples
- Notebook TRQSTest.nb contains some examples.
