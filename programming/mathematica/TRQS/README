* Configuration
The MathLink source files must be configure prior to the compilation. Edit
TRQS.h file to define QUANTIS_DEVICE_TYPE (QUANTIS_DEVICE_USB or
QUANTIS_DEVICE_PCI) and QUANTIS_DEVICE_ID (eg. 0) according to your hardware
configuration.

* Compilation

In order to compile *.tm source files one should note that
- A working Mathematica installation is required.
- We assume that header files are installed in /usr/local/IDQ/Quantis/include
  and libraries in /usr/local/IDQ/Quantis/lib. Modify QUANTIS_HOME in the
  Makefile if this is not the case.

* Instalation
- Copy TRQS.m to $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications director
- Copy compiled files to $HOME/.Mathematica/Applications/TRQS_Quantis directory

* Examples
Notebook TRQSTest.nb contains some examples.
